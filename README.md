This portfolio intends to showcase work and various skills required of a web designer & developer. Through many iterations showcased here on my github account I hope to display my skills for any interested parties.

I am interested in the many aspects of tech and internet related fields. I am currently enjoying learning and growing in Utah. I am focusing heavily on diving deep into Javascript and React in order to spice up all of my endeavors. I have historically worked primarily in Marketing roles but regularly put my programming skills to work in my tools and processes.

I have many interests and I hope to be more actively engaged in many emerging technologies. Please enjoy this github repository that allows me to simply host this tasteful portfolio for your viewing pleasure.
